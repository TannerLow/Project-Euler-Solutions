# Project Euler Solutions
Project Euler is a website (https://projecteuler.net) that has over 600 math/computer science problems ranging from relatively easy to very hard. Problems have no time limit for how long your program can run but it is encouraged to optimize solutions that are particularly slow.

Here are some Java and Python solutions to various problems from projecteuler.net. This repository is still actively being updated.
